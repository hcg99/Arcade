Arcade_Adv & Arcade_Basic are both the same arcade-style game to be enjoyed in your browser window. 

Your character is a green snake made up of 5 segments and can move only horizontally. 5 orange blocks repeatedly appear at the top of the screen and travel down towards your snake. You must navigate your snake to the gap in these blocks lest you let them hit you and lose a segment of the snake's body. The gap in the blocks changes position randomly. Once you have lost all segments, your score (the number of waves of blocks you have survived) will appear on the screen.

Arcade_Basic is the barebones version - Arcade_Adv
